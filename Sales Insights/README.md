# *Sales Insight Tableau Dashboard*
Created an analysis project for revenue and profit analysis and build an interactive dashboard in Tableau that provides live information on electronic products sales to make marketing strategies target customers according to geographic locations in India.

According to the client's requirements, I focused on:
1) Identify the target market for these products
2) Understand how to best brand and position them
3) Identify issues in product sales, and competitors and benchmark their success

Closely worked with stakeholders that included a Sales Director, Marketing, Customer service, Data analysis, and IT team for Data munging, extraction, and transform the data. Based on the suggestions from stakeholders I made visualized data in two Tableau dashboards.
